Gradle plugin for providing dependency resolution rules.

Gradle resolution strategies and module metadata provide an effective way to mediate the dependency resolution process in your builds, however they don't adapt well to enterprises that need a curated and shared source for rules.

The [Blacklist Plugin](https://github.com/nebula-plugins/gradle-blacklist-plugin) allows this problem to be solved with enterprise plugins for specific cases. This plugin provides general purpose rule types and supports artifact based configuration, allowing rules to be versioned and dependency locked.

# Usage

    buildscript {
        repositories {
            jcenter()
        }

        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.netflix.nebula:gradle-resolution-rules-plugin:1.0.0'
        }
    }

    apply plugin: 'nebula.resolution-rules'

Or using the Gradle plugin portal:

    plugins {
        id 'nebula.resolution-rules' version '1.0.0'
    }

# Dependency rules types

## Replace
 
Replace rules cause dependencies to be replaced with one at different coordinates, if both dependencies are present, avoiding class conflicts due to coordinate relocations.

## Substitute

Dependency is force replaced with new coordinates, regardless if the new dependency is visible in the graph.

## Deny

Deny rules fail the build if the specified dependency is present, forcing consumers to make a decision about the replacement of a dependency.

Versions are optional, and access to an entire dependency can be denied. This is particularly useful for 'bundle' style dependencies, which fat jar dependencies without shading classes.
 
## Reject 

Reject rules prevent a dependency version from being considered by dynamic version or `latest.*` version calculation. It does not prevent that dependency from being used if it's explicitly requested by the project.

# Consuming rules

Dependency rules are read from the `resolutionRules` configuration. Zip and jar archives are supported, as are flat JSON files. JSON files within archives can at any directory level, and more than one json file can be provided.

    dependencies {
        resolutionRules files('local-rules.json')
        resolutionRules 'com.myorg:resolution-rules:latest.release'
    }
    
# Producing rules

The `nebula.resolution-rules-producer' plugin is provided to facilitate creation of rules files. Documentation for it can be found later in this document.

# Gradle resolution-rules-producer Plugin

This plugin can be used to validate and package rule files. To use, put your rules file (or files) in `src/resolutionRules` and execute the packageRules task. If successful, a jar with the validated rule files will be placed in your build directory.

# Usage

    buildscript {
        repositories {
            jcenter()
        }

        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.netflix.nebula:gradle-resolution-rules-plugin:1.0.0'
        }
    }

    apply plugin: 'nebula.resolution-rules-producer'

Or using the Gradle plugin portal:

    plugins {
        id 'nebula.resolution-rules' version '1.0.0'
    }


Once configured, run the following:

    $ ./gradlew packageRules
    

# Customizing rule file locations

    checkResolutionRulesSyntax {
        rules files('./alternative-rules.json', './src/rules/moreRules.json')
    }
